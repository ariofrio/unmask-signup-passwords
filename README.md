# Unmask signup passwords

Inspired by an interesting [article][] on Smashing Magazine, this user script unmasks password fields when they are focused, using a lighter and smaller font to aid privacy.

Additionally, this user script will disable the second password field, and automatically copy your password
over to it. [Install it][] and [try it out][]!
